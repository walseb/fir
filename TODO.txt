Basic types:
  - ()
  - more widths for Word / Int / Float
  - pointers ???

Compound types:
  - Arrays (containing any basic type)
  - Records/structs (containing any other types)
  - (Syntactic sugar for) complex numbers & quaternions
  - (Syntactic sugar for) tuples

Operations:
  - comparison (using Ordering, not just < <= > >=)
  - rounding operations
  - bitwise operations on numeric types
  - way to lift operations to vectors (like 'fmap')
  - load/store through pointers???
  - glsl utility operations (clamp, mix, step, smoothstep, ...)


Control flow:
  - switch
  - loops


need to think about records/structs and in particular memory layout & alignment concerns
structs should use type-level symbols to access individual components
arrays should use runtime ints


turn back on the unused do bind thing and make it so that there are no warnings
